[OpenEXR](http://www.openexr.org) is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format for use in computer imaging applications.

[OpenEXR](http://www.openexr.org)'s features include:
  * Higher dynamic range and color precision than existing 8- and 10-bit image file formats.
  * Support for 16-bit floating-point, 32-bit floating-point, and 32-bit integer pixels.
  * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms.
  * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily be added. New image attributes (strings, vectors, integers, etc.) can be added to [OpenEXR](http://www.openexr.org) image headers without affecting backward compatibility with existing [OpenEXR](http://www.openexr.org) applications.

**The goal of this project** is to provide easy access to [OpenEXR](http://www.openexr.org) files in Java.
